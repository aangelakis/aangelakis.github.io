I am an MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Crete](https://www.uoc.gr/en/home/), working with Dr. [George Kafentzis](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~kafentz/) on adaptive MFCCs for speech signal processing. I also serve as a Teaching Assistant in his courses.

In parallel, I am a research intern at the Data Science Lab of [IACM-FORTH](https://www.iacm.forth.gr/), collaborating with Dr. [Yannis Pantazis](https://sites.google.com/site/yannispantazis/) on projects involving machine learning, generative AI, and representation learning, including contributions to the [NeuroDiMe](https://github.com/YannisPantazis/neuroDiME) library.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Crete (GPA: 8.77/10.00, 7th out of 49), where I also served as a teaching assistant for multiple undergraduate courses, a peer mentor, and participated in outreach events.

I have received several academic honors, including undergraduate scholarships from the University of Crete and the [State Scholarships Foundation (IKY)](https://www.iky.gr/en/).
