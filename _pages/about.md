I am a MSc. student in [Computer Science and Engineering at University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), and currently a graduate research fellow at [IACM-FORTH](https://www.iacm.forth.gr/), where I work no topics of machine learning, deep learning, software development and data science with [Yannis Pantazis](https://sites.google.com/site/yannispantazis/). My interests span the areas of deep learning, signal (speech) processing, and machine learning. 

I obtained my BSc. from the Computer Science Department of University of Crete, where I graduated 7th (among 49 students) in class in July 2023 with honours (8.77/10.00).

I've also volunteered in a lot of different activites like peer mentoring, helping with presentations and events to high school students as well as being a TA in my undergraduate studies.

I've also obtained several honors and awards across my undegraduate studies including undegraduate scholarships from the University of Crete and the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).
