I am an MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr) (GPA: **9.64/10.00**), with a focus on **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing**. My thesis explores **Adaptive Sinusoidal Models for Parkinson's disease**. I am also a member of the [Speech Signal Processing Lab](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~sspl/) as an MSc student. In addition, I serve as a Teaching Assistant in the *Applied Mathematics for Engineers* and *Digital Signal Processing* courses, supporting lectures, grading, and student mentoring.

## Research & Industry Experience

In parallel, I am a research intern at the [Data Science Lab of IACM-FORTH](https://www.iacm.forth.gr/divisions/numerical-analysis-computational-systems/data-science), working with Dr. Yannis Pantazis. I led the development of **NeuroDiMe**, a unified Python library for neural-based estimation of statistical distances (e.g., f-divergences, IPMs), which supports **PyTorch, JAX, and TensorFlow**. This tool is used in cutting-edge AI workflows, including $\beta$-VAE representation learning and GAN/VAE generative modeling. Since June 2024, the NeuroDiMe project has been supported by **Apple Inc.** through IACM.

I also contributed to the IACM's research on complex systems by **designing and implementing graph traversal algorithms** for **optimal sensor placement** in Water Distribution Networks, enabling accurate leak localization using **Python, GeoPandas, NetworkX, and GIS**.

My recent research at the Speech Signal Processing Lab involves developing deep learning models for **Tuberculosis detection** from cough audio signals, achieving robust classification between healthy and unhealthy samples using **Python, Sklearn, and TensorFlow**. I have also assisted in building and evaluating a 20-hour multi-speaker Greek speech dataset, training state-of-the-art text-to-speech models with **ESPnet**.

## Academic Background & Honors

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Crete (GPA: **8.77/10.00**), where I worked as a teaching assistant for several courses, including *Applied Mathematics for Engineers*, *Probabilities*, and *Information System Analysis and Design*. I have received multiple academic honors, including **four scholarships from the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY)** between 2020-2023 and the **Chrysanthos and Anastasia Karidis Scholarship** for outstanding performance in the national entrance exams.

I have actively engaged in the academic community by delivering outreach presentations to high school students, highlighting research from the Speech Signal Processing Laboratory, and mentoring first-year students through the **STEER mentoring program** as a Peer Mentor.
