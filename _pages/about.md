I am a MSc student in [Computer Science and Engineering at University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en), and currently a graduate research fellow at [IACM-FORTH](https://www.iacm.forth.gr/). I work on topics related to machine learning, deep learning, software development, and data science with [Yannis Pantazis](https://sites.google.com/site/yannispantazis/). My interests span the areas of deep learning, signal (speech) processing, and machine learning. 

I obtained my BSc from the Computer Science Department of the University of Crete, where I graduated 7th out of 49 students in my class in July 2023 with honors, achieving a GPA of 8.77/10.00.

During my undergraduate studies, I actively volunteered in various activities, such as peer mentoring, assisting with presentations and events for high school students, and serving as a teaching assistant.

I have also received several honors and awards throughout my undergraduate studies, including scholarships from the University of Crete and the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY).
