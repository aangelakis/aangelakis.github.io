I am an MSc student in Computer Science and Engineering at the [University of Crete](https://www.csd.uoc.gr) (GPA: **9.64/10.00**), with a focus on Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing. My thesis explores adaptive Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for speech signal processing, under the supervision of Dr. George Kafentzis. I am also a member of the [Speech Signal Processing Lab](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/~sspl/) as an MSc student. In addition, I serve as a Teaching Assistant in the *Applied Mathematics for Engineers* and *Digital Signal Processing* courses, supporting lectures, grading, and student mentoring.

In parallel, I am a research intern at the [Data Science Lab of IACM-FORTH](https://www.iacm.forth.gr/divisions/numerical-analysis-computational-systems/data-science), working with Dr. Yannis Pantazis. I contributed to the development of **NeuroDiMe**, a unified Python library for neural-based estimation of statistical distances (e.g., f-divergences, IPMs), used in representation learning and generative modeling. Since June 2024, the project has been supported by **Apple Inc.**

My recent research at the Speech Signal Processing Lab involves analyzing spectral features of cough audio signals for **Tuberculosis detection** using deep learning techniques. I have also assisted in testing a new multi-speaker Greek speech dataset to support advancements in text-to-speech systems.

I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the University of Crete (GPA: **8.77/10.00**), where I worked as a teaching assistant for several courses, participated in outreach events, and mentored first-year students. I have received multiple academic honors, including **three scholarships from the State Scholarships Foundation (IKY)** and the **Chrysanthos and Anastasia Karidis Scholarship** for outstanding performance in the national entrance exams.
